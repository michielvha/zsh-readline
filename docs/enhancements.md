# Potential Enhancements

The following enhancements should be investigated and tried:

- when we select an entry from the list it is put in on the current line in terminal but not executed making it so we have to press enter twice - we should make it auto apply that when we select it from the list (this should be configurable behaviour) - verify how psreadline does this (for consistency)

- Multi-line command handling

- Color highlighting (uses `>` prefix instead for now)
